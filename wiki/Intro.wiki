#summary Intro.

== Introduction ==
This program allows you to rename files in your media collection using information retrieved from theTVDB.com using the tvdb_api (see http://github.com/dbr/tvdb_api).

Yes, this is a solved problem but it was something I thought would be interesting enough to try myself. And yes, this is probably only read by me, but if you are here, welcome!
